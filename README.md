Project description: A convenient way to view all the addresses associated to the one you searched for, all in a single spreadsheet
In my opinion, this is better than having to visit https://developers.onemap.sg/commonapi/search?returnGeom=Y&getAddrDetails=Y&pageNum=2&searchVal=sol%20acres
and edit the pageNum value manually

How to use: In cell B1 of 'Sheet1' tab, search for the building name/address. Head to 'Results' tab to view all the associated addresses
